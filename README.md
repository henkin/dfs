## Todo and Task REST API for DFS Interview 
### Paul Henkin

Main project is [Todos.Web](Todos.Web) - it's dotnet core, and requires the toolchain to build.

This is an API for managing a TODO list. The API is able to manage the creation of a list as well as the items inside of the list. The basic API design can be found in this swagger specification: 

## Installing and running

* `dotnet build`
* `dotnet run`
* Navigate to the url it's running (eg http://localhost:5000)
* click on 'swagger'
